#Summary of Key Steps:

1. Importing Libraries:
   - Necessary libraries for data analysis are imported, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `seaborn`.

2. Gathering Data:
   - You load customer, order, product, and sales data from CSV files hosted online.

3. Assessing Data:
   - For each dataframe, you check the structure using `info()`, identify missing values with `isna()`, and check for duplicates using `duplicated()`.
   - You also generate descriptive statistics using `describe()`.

4. Cleaning Data:
   - **Removing Duplicates**: You identify and drop duplicate entries in the `customers_df` and `product_df`.
   - **Handling Missing Values**: You replace missing gender values with "Prefer not to say" and confirm there are no remaining missing values.
   - **Correcting Inaccurate Values**: You handle extreme values in the `age` column by capping the maximum age.
   - **Changing Data Types**: You convert date columns in `orders_df` to `datetime` type for better analysis.

5. Data Checks:
   - After cleaning, you re-check the dataframes for duplicates and missing values to ensure data integrity.

#Next Steps:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Use visualizations to explore relationships between variables. For example, plot:
     - Age distribution of customers.
     - Number of orders per customer.
     - Total sales over time.
   - Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create insightful visualizations.

2. Data Merging:
   - Consider merging the datasets to perform a more comprehensive analysis. For instance, you could merge `customers_df` with `orders_df` to analyze customer behavior.

3. Feature Engineering:
   - Create new features that might help in your analysis, such as:
     - Total spend per customer.
     - Average order value.
     - Recency, frequency, and monetary (RFM) metrics for customer segmentation.

4. Statistical Analysis or Machine Learning:
   - Depending on your project goals, apply statistical tests to understand relationships or build predictive models (e.g., regression models to predict sales based on customer demographics).

5. Documentation and Reporting:
   - Document your findings and analyses clearly. You could create a Jupyter Notebook that combines code, outputs, and markdown explanations to present your work effectively.

6. Data Export:
   - If necessary, export cleaned data or results to new CSV files for further analysis or reporting.
